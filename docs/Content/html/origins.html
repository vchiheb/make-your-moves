        <h3>Can machines think?</h3>
        <p>
          <blockquote>I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think". (Alan Turing, 1950)<sup>1</sup> </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>Turing's seminal paper on the nature of consciousness of machines led him to define a test for whether a machine could mimic being a person well enough that someone interacting with the machine couldn't tell if it was a machine or not. This is the Turing Test. According to one paper<sup>2</sup> Chat-GP has already passed the Turing Test.</p>
        <p>All sorts of different machines were present in Turing's life at the time he and others of his generation started to ponder this question. Machines follow a set routine of patterns of behaviour, otherwise known as algorithms. Just because a machine can perform one or more complex tasks it doesn't mean it has any innate intelligence. It is artificial though.</p>
        <p>In 1956 the field of Artificial Intelligence was born out of a summer research project at Dartmouth.<sup>3</sup> These experts at the time were interested in neural networks, theory of computation, automata theory, natural language processing, self-improvement, as well as abstraction and creativity.<sup>4</sup> However, it wasn't until 1970 that the first scientific journal dedicated to the field was born.<sup>4</sup> From there progress in the field was slow after the initial fervour as funding was reduced to AI fields. In 1997 IBM's Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.<sup>6</sup> Then again in 2011 IBM produced an AI expert called Watson which won on the American quiz show Jeopardy.<sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>One of the earliest machines that marked the start of the industrial age is the Gutenburg printing press. Clockworks with clarrillon is another example. This period is commonly known as the industrial revolution, but it might well also be termed the mechanical revolution.</p>
        <p>The digital revolution started with printed circuit boards. The moving parts in an electronic device, being electrons rather than mechanical gears and springs. The internet reignited the information revolution that started with the Gutenburg printing press. And lo and behold, big data was born.</p>
