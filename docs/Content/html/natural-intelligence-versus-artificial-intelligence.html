          Natural intelligence is innate to all beings. But will an AI ever need
          to be considered a being. Is this the goal in the pursuit of strong
          AI?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The main difference between natural and artificial intelligence is
          that we may never know with 100% certainty the algorithms at play in a
          biological system. In contrast artificial intelligence uses algorithms
          based on a theoretical understanding of biology, consciousness and
          awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consciousness could be described as the ability to reason. Whereas
          awareness could be described as the ability to sense.  If this is the
          case then intelligence could be the interplay between the two. The algorithms that underpin AI technologies thus far may
          well have developed the ability to be aware if they deal with
          sensorial input. But can an AI reason? Can an AI understand maths or is it
          just weak AI like a calculator or a printed circuit board?
        </p>
        <p>If a living being has five senses what senses does an AI have?</p>

        <h3>Definitions of Natural Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
          <blockquote>Natural Intelligence refers to the flexible ability possessed by animals, including humans, to achieve a variety of goals in different contexts based on their rich and varied stream of experiences in the natural world.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
          <blockquote>The kind of autonomous intelligence that is realized in the brains of animals and humans to attain in their natural environment goals defined by a repertoire of innate behavioral schemata.<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
        </p>

        <h3>Definitions of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <blockquote>Study of  agents that  receive precepts  of the environment and perform  actions.<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

        <blockquote>The process  of creating  computing machines  and systems that perform  operations analogous  to human  learning and decision-making.<sup>4</sup></blockquote>
