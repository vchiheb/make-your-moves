        text: "Consciousness could be described as the ability to reason. Whereas awareness could be described as the ability to sense. If this is the case then intelligence could be the interplay between the two. The algorithms that underpin AI technologies thus far may well have developed the ability to be aware if they deal with sensorial input. But can an AI reason? Can an AI understand maths or is it just weak AI like a calculator or a printed circuit board?",
